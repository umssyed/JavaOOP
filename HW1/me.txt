Hello! 

My name is Muhammad Uzair Shahid Syed and my preferred name is Uzair Syed.

I am in the Masters of Computer Science program at Georgia Tech and currently debating between the Machine Learning and Computing Systems track.
My bachelor's was in Electrical Engineering and I have been in the industry for around 7 years as an Industrial Controls Automation engineer.
I was enrolled in the program in January 2022 and have completed 5 courses so far. This summer I am taking CS 8001-OOP (this course) 
and Software Development Process. The reason to choose this class was to get a good understanding of Java since the Software Development Process 
course uses Java and I have not yet been exposed to this language.

My personal interest includes snowboarding, painting, gaming (just finished Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5!) and learning how to code.
I am currently looking to transition to more of a Software engineering career. My hope is to use the Georgia Tech's Masters program to
be able to successfully complete this transition. I currently live in Calgary in Canada and work for a major pipeline company.

So far, I am loving this program and have learnt an insane amount thanks to the effort of the professors and TAs in this program!

Thank you for making this course and the program one of the top Comptuer Science program across the world!

Uzair Syed
